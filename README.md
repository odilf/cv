## How was it made

I made my CV with typst, inspired by the [`grotesk-cv`](https://typst.app/universe/package/grotesk-cv/) template. However, I ended up throwing it all out and starting from scratch to have more fine grained control, and so this version doesn't use any of `grotesk-cv`'s code anymore.
